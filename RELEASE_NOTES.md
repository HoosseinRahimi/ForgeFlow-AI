# ForgeFlow AI v0.13.0 Community Showcase

This is the first curated public showcase milestone derived from the private ForgeFlow AI development platform.

## Included concepts

- Role-aware project workspace
- Student/professor workflows
- Project/activity tracking
- GitHub contribution intelligence
- Persistent AI project copilot
- Repository indexing and bounded lexical RAG
- Diff-aware code-review assistance
- Debugging assistance from logs/errors plus repository context
- Evidence-backed progress intelligence
- Project health scoring
- Daily and weekly project intelligence
- Notifications derived from project state
- Seven-specialist multi-agent orchestration
- Governed AI action lifecycle: `propose -> approve -> execute`
- FastAPI + React/TypeScript + SQLite architecture
- CI, E2E and dependency-audit quality gates

## Deliberately excluded

This public milestone does not mirror private production state. It excludes real team/user data, runtime databases, sessions, submissions, grading state, credentials, private deployment configuration and internal operational data.

## Current technical limits

- Repository retrieval is lexical chunk retrieval, not embedding/vector semantic search.
- Provider-backed AI behavior requires runtime provider credentials in deployments that enable it.
- Governed GitHub write actions require server-side credentials and explicit approval.
- In-app notifications are distinct from external email/Slack/push delivery.
- The public showcase is a curated release surface, not a full production deployment bundle.
