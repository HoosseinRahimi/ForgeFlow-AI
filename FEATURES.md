## Governed actions

AI actions use a controlled lifecycle:

1. propose
2. approve
3. execute

Supported internal concepts include task creation, progress updates, decision recording and GitHub evidence linking. External GitHub write operations are server-controlled and require runtime credentials plus explicit approval.

## Engineering quality

- FastAPI backend
- React + TypeScript frontend
- SQLite migrations
- pytest + coverage
- ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript checks
- Vitest unit tests
- Playwright E2E
- dependency audits
- CodeQL on supported public/private configurations
- pull-request CI gates

## Public-edition boundary

ForgeFlow AI Community Showcase is not a drop-in mirror of the private production repository. Sensitive operational surfaces, private data, runtime state and credentials are deliberately excluded.
